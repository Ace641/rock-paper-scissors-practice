# rock-paper-scissors-practice
A rock paper scissors game in Python is simple! Here is a repository for you to practice clone, git commit and git push. You can also try pull, fork and open/close issues! 
- Please Please remember to add comments for your code if you think that it is not easily readable 
- For this, please add your name on your project! Thank you!
- Push your code in one folder with your name. It's just a practice! : )
